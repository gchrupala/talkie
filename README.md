## Installation

The code can be installed using using the setup script, preferably in a virtual environment:

virtualenv -p python3 .
source bin/activate
python setup develop
```

In order to use the forced alignment functionality, the [Gentle toolkit](https://github.com/lowerquality/gentle) with its associated Python library also needs to be installed.
